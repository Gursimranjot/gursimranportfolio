  turned industry professional

  As a disclaimer, I am NOT endorsing, or sponsored by any tech bootcamp,
  masters program, online education resource, UX coach, or anything along those
  lines. I am merely stating what I have noticed, and what has worked for me as
  a former bootcamp student who successfully transitioned into a full-time user
  experience career.

  Brand-new UX designers who connect with me on LinkedIn ask me this question A LOT. And instead of answering each person individually (which can be quite time-consuming), I believe it will be much more helpful to simply write an article about it for anyone to reference at any time.

  User experience is undoubtedly a massively growing field that is becoming more and more prevalent among the exponential explosion of demand for tech. And because of this, it is not only attracting aspiring UX designers enrolled in (or recently graduated from) college but also a considerable amount of people transitioning careers from some other field into user experience.

**It wasnâ€™t until December of 2015 at the age of 26 that I came across a blog from CareerFoundry, highlighting what user experience is, and why it is so important.**

I had never heard of it, although it sounded like an interesting profession to be a part of. I could never put my finger on WHAT I was supposed to be doing; I was a very creative person who also enjoyed science, research, and contextualizing why things function the way they do.
